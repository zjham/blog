<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Zach. Welcome to my blog, which I have created to document my journey into the world of <em>Data Science</em>. Playing with data and statistics/probability has always been the thing I could do for hours and hours and not realize that any time had passed. I began learning R so that I could dive deeper into this passion of mine. I chose R for the array of open source learning materials and how accessible the community felt. R is also incredibly powerful and friendly to novice programmers (think learning how to ride a bike and doing backflips off of jumps at the end of the first day). I plan to use this outlet to practice my data wrangling and analysis skills in R on datasets that span my many interests.</p>
<p>With that said, here is the first plot that I ever made in R. I tracked the weight of my labrador puppy, Olive, over the first few months of her life and used R to visualize this trend:</p>

<p>I had just finished reading <a href="https://r4ds.had.co.nz/">R for Data Science</a> and had a very vague knowledge of tidyverse data manipulation verbs and knew that they played well with the <strong>ggplot</strong> function so this was the result (I hadn’t learned much about formatting yet…) It might not be much, but I realized from this simple exercise how powerful R could be and I absolutely had to learn more.</p>
<p>After that, I did some more reading and became very excited by the concept of the <em>pipe operator</em>, as you can see from the code below, and came up with a visualization that shows the batting average of AL West Division MLB teams from 2011 to 2016, courtesy of data from the Lahman database!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidyverse)
library(Lahman)

#Batting average by team 

Batting %&gt;%
  filter(yearID &gt; 2010, lgID == &quot;AL&quot;) %&gt;%
  left_join(Teams, by = c(&quot;yearID&quot;, &quot;teamID&quot;)) %&gt;%
  filter(divID == &quot;W&quot; &amp; lgID.x == &quot;AL&quot;) %&gt;%
  group_by(yearID, teamID) %&gt;%
  summarise(batavg = round(sum(H.x) / sum(AB.x), 3)) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(yearID, batavg, colour = teamID)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0.3) +
  ggtitle(&quot;Batting Average&quot;) +
  labs(x = &quot;Year&quot;, y = &quot;Batting Average&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>I won’t normally show my code unless I am illustrating a certain new concept I’ve learned or something, but all source material will be available on my <a href="https://github.com/zjham/blog">Github</a>. Big thanks to Jenny Bryan’s <a href="http://happygitwithr.com/">helpful resource</a> on Git &amp; version control and Yihui Xie’s <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">intro to blogdown</a> for helping me get this blog up and running painlessly. I’ll end here for now, I promise the content in future posts will have nicer formatting. Thanks for reading!</p>
